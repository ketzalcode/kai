## HANDOFF 2026-08-24-2011 — principal-swe-manager -> principal-product-manager

- did:       Created this `proposed` record — the CI capstone of `dependency-guarantees`. Wires the `--all` self-test + collision/partial-install/version-skew arms as real CI gates, adds `kai-core-*` namespace enforcement, and carries architect caveat (a): the **forced** rename `fleet-observation` -> `kai-core-fleet-observation`. Size L. Owner `principal-swe-infra`; review `principal-swe-architect`/independent-architecture. Depends on `pack-split-crosspack-validator` + `pack-split-preflight-compat` (shipped).
- state:     proposed
- needs:     Steward grooming + promotion; note the rename is forced (prefix CI goes red until it lands) and contained (orphan skill — no inheritance refs).
- artifacts: kai/coordination/items/pack-split-ci-partition-checks.md; decomposition WS#6
- evidence:  grep — `fleet-observation` in skills/ dir + generate-catalog.mjs (line ~153) + test/fixtures/inventory.json + docs; no agent `**Inherits:**` it — captured 2026-08-24 from C:\src\kai
- questions: director availability membership-not-count — confirm the "partly landed" work is complete (decomposition Open Question 4)
- next:      principal-product-manager — groom milestone-by-milestone; must precede `pack-split-generated-pack-trees`.
